## Known Issues

### Composite Resources and Linux

The commands and tasks that generate documentation for composite resources require
the `configuration` statement that is provided by DSC. DSC is not installed
on Linux by default, so these commands will fail on Linux if the DSC
resource module contains any composite resources. To enable these commands to work
on Linux, please install [PowerShell DSC for Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerShell-DSC-for-Linux).

## Commands

Refer to the [repository Wiki](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.DocGenerator/wiki)
for more information about the commands.

The information is also available in the comment-based help by running:

```powershell
Get-Help -Name <CmdletName> -Detailed
```

## Tasks

These are `Invoke-Build` tasks. The build tasks are primarily meant to be
run by the project [Sampler's](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler)
`build.ps1` which wraps `Invoke-Build` and has the configuration file
(`build.yaml`) to control its behavior.

To make the tasks available for the command `Invoke-Build` in a repository
that is based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project,
add this module to the file `RequiredModules.psd1` and then in the file
`build.yaml` add the following:

```yaml
ModuleBuildTasks:
  DscResource.DocGenerator:
    - 'Task.*'
```

### `Clean_Markdown_Of_Public_Commands`

This build task runs the command `Edit-CommandDocumentation` on each markdown
file that was generated by the task `Generate_Markdown_For_Public_Commands`.

See the command `Edit-CommandDocumentation` for more information.

Below is an example how the build task can be used when a repository is
based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project.

>[!NOTE] This task is meant to be run after the tasks
>`Generate_Markdown_For_Public_Commands` and `Generate_Wiki_Content`, but
>before the task `Clean_Markdown_Metadata`.

```yaml
BuildWorkflow:
  '.':
    - build

  build:
    - Clean
    - Build_Module_ModuleBuilder
    - Build_NestedModules_ModuleBuilder
    - Create_changelog_release_output
    - Generate_Wiki_Content
    - Generate_Markdown_For_Public_Commands
    - Clean_Markdown_Of_Public_Commands

  publish:
    - Publish_release_to_GitHub
    - publish_module_to_gallery
    - Publish_GitHub_Wiki_Content
```

### `Clean_Markdown_Metadata`

This build task runs the command `Remove-MarkdownMetadataBlock` on each markdown
file that is present in the folder provided by the parameter `DocOutputFolder`
(defaults to _./output/WikiContent_).

See the command `Remove-MarkdownMetadataBlock` for more information.

Below is an example how the build task can be used when a repository is
based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project.

>[!NOTE] This task is meant to be run after all tasks that generate of modifies
>markdown.

```yaml
BuildWorkflow:
  '.':
    - build

  build:
    - Clean
    - Build_Module_ModuleBuilder
    - Build_NestedModules_ModuleBuilder
    - Create_changelog_release_output
    - Generate_Wiki_Content
    - Generate_Markdown_For_Public_Commands
    - Clean_Markdown_Metadata

  publish:
    - Publish_release_to_GitHub
    - publish_module_to_gallery
    - Publish_GitHub_Wiki_Content
```

### `Copy_Source_Wiki_Folder`

This build task will copy the content of the wiki source folder if it exist
(the parameter `WikiSourceFolderName` defaults to `WikiSource`). The wiki
source folder should be located under the source folder, e.g. `source/WikiSource`.
The wiki source folder is meant to contain additional documentation that
will be added to folder `WikiOutput` during build, and then published to
the wiki during the deploy stage (if either the command `Publish-WikiContent`
or the task `Publish_GitHub_Wiki_Content` is used).

if the `Home.md` is present in the folder specified in `WikiSourceFolderName`
it will be copied to `WikiOutput` and all module version placeholders (`#.#.#`)
of the content the file will be replaced with the built module version.

### `Create_Wiki_Output_Folder`

This build task creates the folder `output/WikiContent`.

Below is an example how the build task can be used when a repository is
based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project.

```yaml
BuildWorkflow:
  '.':
    - build

  docs:
    - Create_Wiki_Output_Folder
    - Generate_Markdown_For_Public_Commands
    - Clean_Markdown_Of_Public_Commands
    - Copy_Source_Wiki_Folder
    - Generate_Wiki_Sidebar
    - Clean_Markdown_Metadata
    - Package_Wiki_Content
```

### `Generate_Conceptual_Help`

This build task runs the command `New-DscResourcePowerShellHelp`.

Below is an example how the build task can be used when a repository is
based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project.

```yaml
BuildWorkflow:
  '.':
    - build

  build:
    - Clean
    - Build_Module_ModuleBuilder
    - Build_NestedModules_ModuleBuilder
    - Create_changelog_release_output
    - Generate_Conceptual_Help
```

If the schema mof property descriptions contain markdown code then it is
possible to configure regular expressions to remove the markdown code.
The regular expressions must be written so that capture group 0 returns
the full match and the capture group 1 returns the text that should be kept.
For example the regular expression `` \`(.+?)\` `` will find `` `$true` ``
which will be replaced to `$true` since that is what will be returned by
capture group 1.

Below is some example regular expressions for the most common markdown code.

>**NOTE:** Each regular expression must be able to find multiple matches
>on the same row.

```yaml
DscResource.DocGenerator:
  Generate_Conceptual_Help:
    MarkdownCodeRegularExpression:
      - '\`(.+?)\`' # Match inline code-block
      - '\\(\\)' # Match escaped backslash
      - '\[[^\[]+\]\((.+?)\)' # Match markdown URL
      - '_(.+?)_' # Match Italic (underscore)
      - '\*\*(.+?)\*\*' # Match bold
      - '\*(.+?)\*' # Match Italic (asterisk)
```

>**NOTE:** If the task is used in a module that is using the project [Sampler's](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler)
>`build.ps1` then version 0.102.1 of [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler)
>is required.

### `Generate_External_Help_File_For_Public_Commands`

This build task runs the command `New-ExternalHelp` (PlatyPS command) that
will generate an external help file for the module based on the generated
markdown. See the command `New-ExternalHelp` for more information.

It is possible to pass `HelpCultureInfo` (default is `en-US`), it can be
set either in parent scope, as an environment variable, or if passed as
a parameter to the build task.

Below is an example how the build task can be used when a repository is
based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project.

>[!NOTE] This task is meant to be run after the tasks
>`Generate_Markdown_For_Public_Commands`, and it is meant that the task
>`Clean_Markdown_Of_Public_Commands` is ran after.

>[!NOTE] This task is meant to be run after all the needed tasks that generate
> markdown documentation. It must be run before `Clean_Markdown_Metadata`.

run if the variable `$GitHubToken` is set either in parent scope, as an
environment variable, or if passed to the build task.

See the command `Publish-WikiContent` for more information.

Below is an example how the build task can be used when a repository is
based on the [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) project.
