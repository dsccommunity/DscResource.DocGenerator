# Change log for DscResource.DocGenerator

The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added build tasks `Generate_Wiki_Content` (that runs the cmdlet
  `New-DscResourceWikiPage`). The build task is primarily meant to be run by
  the project [Sampler's](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) `build.ps1`.
  To make the task available for `Invoke-Build` in a repository that is based
  on [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler) add this module to
  required modules, and then in the `build.yaml` add the following.
  ```yaml
  ModuleBuildTasks:
    DscResource.DocGenerator:
      - 'Task.*'
  ```
